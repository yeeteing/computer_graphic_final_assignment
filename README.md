### Functionalities
[x] illuminated scene. Two or more light sources to illuminate the scene.
    [x] switchable light using keyboard.
    [x] changing one light position and color using the keyboard.
    [x] Varying materials, colors and use of textures is expected
    
[x] efficient, intuitive navigation must be presented

[x] Use of textures on the models.

[x] elements are moving in a hierarchical relationship with other elements, in the form of platforms carrying other objects, a solar system, or a pair of objects rotating around each other, illustrating the use of cumulative transformations.

[x] A “novel component”: A graphics technique that has not been part of the previous assignments.
For instance, a method that might have been described as an “advanced topic”, or something
that you found interesting, such as particle systems, game AI, new shading effects, something
out of the graphics research literature, such as collision detection between multiple objects,
interactive model deformation, etc.  
    - Solar system, scoring system

[x] Video competition

[x] Implementation using three.js: submit a video with it. Write a clear note to the TA
about the fact that your implementation requires three.js and how to install and evaluate the
submission.
